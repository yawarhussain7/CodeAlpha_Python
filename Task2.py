# TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker 
# ● Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock 
# prices. 
# ● Simplified Scope: 
# ○ User inputs stock names and quantity. 
# ○ Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}). 
# ○ Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a .txt or .csv file. 
# ● Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling 
# (optional).
